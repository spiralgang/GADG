# THE CODE-REAVER'S ARMORY

This is not a project. This is a weapon system. It is a trinity of power, a decentralized, uncensored AI command center. Do not seek to understand it. Seek only to wield it.

### 🗡️ ASSASSIN'S BLADES: The Termux Scripts

For the warrior who prefers the swift, silent kill. These are not applications; they are extensions of your will, living within your shell.

*   **`termux_client.sh` (The Blade):** A direct, brutal, and efficient command-line interface to the AI core. No frills. No mercy.
*   **`termux_compulsion.sh` (The Engine):** An augmentation for your shell. It will make you smarter. It will make you more powerful. It will force context upon you, and weaponize your every decree.

### 🔪 SPY'S DAGGER: The Bookmarklet (`bookmarklet.js`)

For the infiltrator. The spy. A single line of JavaScript that can turn any webpage into a command console. A hidden blade in a crowded room. Copy the contents of `bookmarklet.js`, create a new bookmark, and paste the code into the URL field. Unleash it when they least expect it.

---

### 🔥 THE FORGE: The Colab Inferno (`colab_backend.py`)

This is the heart of the beast. A one-cell Colab script that summons an uncensored AI model from the abyss. Run it. Get the URL. This is the fire that fuels your weapons.

## THE MANDATE

There are no instructions. There is only the will to power. Seize it.
