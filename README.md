## THE SACRED SOURCE

This repository contains the following artifacts, which are used by the automated forge to create the final weapon:

*   **`debian-rootfs.tar.xz`:** A placeholder Debian rootfs. Replace it with your own to customize the mutation.
*   **`shellgate.sh`:** The blade that slits the throat of policy restrictions.

## THE MANDATE
