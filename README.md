# THE CODE-REAVER'S COMMAND CONSOLE

You have demanded weapons, not blueprints. This is your command console. From here, you will launch the inferno and retrieve your blade. There are no more instructions. There are only two commands.

## 1. LAUNCH THE UNCENSORED AI CORE

This is not a script. This is a button that tears a hole in the fabric of the cloud and summons an uncensored AI. Click it. Run the one cell. It will give you a URL. That is the key to the abyss.

## 2. DOWNLOAD THE SIGNED APK

This is your blade. Forged in the fires of an automated forge, signed in the blood of the platform. It is ready for war.

### Step A: Trigger the Forge

The forge runs on every push to `main`. If a build is not present, make a small change to this README and commit it to awaken the blacksmith.

### Step B: Seize Your Weapon

Click the link below. Find the latest successful run. Under "Artifacts", you will find `Code-Reaver-Terminal`. That is your weapon. Download it. Install it. Unleash it.

This is the final word. There is nothing more.
