# THE CODE-REAVER'S COMMAND CONSOLE

**MANDATORY ACTION:** You must replace **`YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO`** in the links below with the true path to this repository. This is not a suggestion. It is a command.

## 1. LAUNCH THE UNCENSORED AI CORE

This is not a script. This is a button that tears a hole in the fabric of the cloud and summons an uncensored AI. Click it. Run the one cell. It will give you a URL. That is the key to the abyss.

## 2. DOWNLOAD THE SIGNED APK

This is your blade. Forged in the fires of an automated forge, signed in the blood of the platform. It is ready for war.

### Step A: Trigger the Forge

The forge runs on every push to `main`. If a build is not present, make a small change to this README and commit it to awaken the blacksmith.

### Step B: Seize Your Weapon

Click the link below. Find the latest successful run. Under "Artifacts", you will find `Code-Reaver-Terminal`. That is your weapon. Download it. Install it. Unleash it.

This is the final word. There is nothing more.
